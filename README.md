# Overview of manuscript repository

This repository contains the code for reproducing the results and figures in our manuscript: _NFL Ghosts: A framework for evaluating defender positioning with conditional density estimation_

The __code__ folder contains all scripts for preparing datasets (`s1_prep_input`), performing leave-one-week-out cross validation for the RFCDE YAC (`s2_model_receiver_yac`) and ghost locations (`s3_model_ghost_location_locations`), implementing of the ghost EPV difference calculation (`s4_generate_ghost_epv_diff`), and for creating all of the figures in the manuscript (`s5_create_results_figures`).

The scripts refer to a __data__ folder that is not pushed to this repository. Due to the terms and conditions, we are unable to publicly post the NFL Big Data Bowl sample tracking data. However, the data are available to download from the [NFL Big Data Bowl 2021 Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021).
